# P14_Airbnb-Listings-Bookings-Analysis

**VERSION 1**

**A. Project Overview**

- This project aims to analyze various aspects of the Albany Airbnb market. In this version, I'd like to get into 03 main ideas:
  + Listing Characteristics: Overview of the type, size, and features of listings in Albany, helping identify the most common accommodation types and pricing ranges (listings.csv)
  + Availability & Pricing Trends: Examine how pricing and availability fluctuate over time and across different types of listings (calendar.csv and listings.csv)
  + Guest Feedback: Sentiment analysis and topic modeling to understand guest satisfaction and common issues (reviews.csv)

  + I. Data Cleaning:
    - I.1. Check Column Type
    - I.2. Check %Blank/Null - Check main columns:

      + calendar: listing_id, date, available, price, minimum_nights, maximum_nights
      + reviews: listing_id, id, date, reviewer_id, reviewer_name
    - I.3. Check %Zero Value - Check Numeric & date columns
    - I.4. Check Outliers - Check main columns (Use min/max or IQR base on cases):
      + listings: price_num, host_response_rate, host_acceptance_rate
      + calendar: date, minimum_nights, maximum_nights, price_num
      + reviews: date
  + II. Query for Insights:
